# CryptoCurrency-Screener


The logic behind the project is simple
Do web scraping from popular Indian news sites and pick up news only related to live cryptocurrency market.

Use the self created APIs and pick out stats like : symbol, name, price, change, change percentage, and market cap of top 25 cryptocurrencies. More cryptocurrencies will be added soon.

Create a website to display information coming from Realtime APIs and then integrate Flask to achieve the same.

Create a realtime trend visualizing chart to visualize the price trends using line chart.

Finally add some fancy css, gifs and animations for better UX
